The primary objective of this project is to evaluate the impact of a new UI feature aimed at increasing the user engagement metrics, specifically the click-through rate or increasing activity booking on the app.

## Methodology
An A/B test was conducted to assess the effectiveness of adding a "Join Event+" button on activity photo, We hypothesized that this would lead to a higher click-through rate and overall booking and revenue.
